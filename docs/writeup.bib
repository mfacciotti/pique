    abstract = {{SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a
                  generic alignment format for storing read alignments
                  against reference sequences, supporting short and
                  long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different
                  sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style,
                  compact in size, efficient in random access and is
                  the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes
                  Project are released. SAMtools implements various
                  utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM
                  format, such as indexing, variant caller and
                  alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools

@article{gaggle,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Systems biologists work with many kinds of
                  data, from many different sources, using a variety
                  of software tools. Each of these tools typically
                  excels at one type of analysis, such as of
                  microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted
                  protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine
                  the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming)
                  data resources and tools to create a data
                  exploration and analysis environment that does
                  justice to the variety and complexity of systems
                  biology data sets. A solution to this problem should
                  recognize that data types, formats and software in
                  this high throughput age of biology are constantly
                  changing.RESULTS:In this paper we describe the
                  Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software
                  environment that helps to solve the problem of
                  software and database integration. Guided by the
                  classic software engineering strategy of separation
                  of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it
                  integrates existing popular programs and web
                  resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended
                  environment.We demonstrate that four simple data
                  types (names, matrices, networks, and associative
                  arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse
                  databases and software. We highlight some
                  capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of
                  Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we
                  identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery
                  made possible by simultaneous data exploration using
                  a wide range of publicly available data and a
                  variety of popular bioinformatics software
                  tools.CONCLUSION:We have integrated diverse
                  databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and
                  software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical
                  environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression
                  Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse
                  software and databases the Gaggle enables
                  simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA
                  and protein abundance, protein-protein and
                  protein-DNA interactions), functional associations
                  (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic
                  pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed
                  abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an
                  exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and
                  spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy
                  computational biologists, and those in between. The
                  Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:High-density tiling arrays and new
                  sequencing technologies are generating rapidly
                  increasing volumes of transcriptome and protein-DNA
                  interaction data. Visualization and exploration of
                  this data is critical to understanding the
                  regulatory logic encoded in the genome by which the
                  cell dynamically affects its physiology and
                  interacts with its environment.RESULTS:The Gaggle
                  Genome Browser is a cross-platform desktop program
                  for interactively visualizing high-throughput data
                  in the context of the genome. Important features
                  include dynamic panning and zooming, keyword search
                  and open interoperability through the Gaggle
                  framework. Users may bookmark locations on the
                  genome with descriptive annotations and share these
                  bookmarks with other users. The program handles
                  large sets of user-generated data using an
                  in-process database and leverages the facilities of
                  SQL and the R environment for importing and
                  manipulating data.A key aspect of the Gaggle Genome
                  Browser is interoperability. By connecting to the
                  Gaggle framework, the genome browser joins a suite
                  of interconnected bioinformatics tools for analysis
                  and visualization with connectivity to major public
                  repositories of sequences, interactions and
                  pathways. To this flexible environment for exploring
                  and combining data, the Gaggle Genome Browser adds
                  the ability to visualize diverse types of data in
                  relation to its coordinates on the
                  genome.CONCLUSIONS:Genomic coordinates function as a
                  common key by which disparate biological data types
                  can be related to one another. In the Gaggle Genome
                  Browser, heterogeneous data are joined by their
                  location on the genome to create information-rich
                  visualizations yielding insight into genome
                  organization, transcription and its regulation and,
                  ultimately, a better understanding of the mechanisms
                  that enable the cell to dynamically respond to its
                  environment.}},

                  throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is rapidly becoming
                  the method of choice for discovering cell-specific
                  transcription factor binding locations genome
                  wide. By aligning sequenced tags to the genome,
                  binding locations appear as peaks in the tag
                  profile. Several programs have been designed to
                  identify such peaks, but program evaluation has been
                  difficult due to the lack of benchmark data sets. We
                  have created benchmark data sets for three
                  transcription factors by manually evaluating a
                  selection of potential binding regions that cover
                  typical variation in peak size and
                  appearance. Performance of five programs on this
                  benchmark showed, first, that external control or
                  background data was essential to limit the number of
                  false positive peaks from the programs. However,
                  >80\% of these peaks could be manually filtered out
                  by visual inspection alone, without using additional
                  background data, showing that peak shape information
                  is not fully exploited in the evaluated
                  programs. Second, none of the programs returned
                  peak-regions that corresponded to the actual
                  resolution in ChIP-seq data. Our results showed that
                  ChIP-seq peaks should be narrowed down to
                  100–400 bp, which is sufficient to identify unique
                  peaks and binding sites. Based on these results, we
                  propose a meta-approach that gives improved peak
                  definitions.}},

                  coupled with massively parallel short-read
                  sequencing (seq) is used to probe chromatin
                  dynamics. Although there are many algorithms to call
                  peaks from ChIP-seq datasets, most are tuned either
                  to handle punctate sites, such as transcriptional
                  factor binding sites, or broad regions, such as
                  histone modification marks; few can do both. Other
                  algorithms are limited in their configurability,
                  performance on large data sets, and ability to
                  distinguish closely-spaced peaks.RESULTS:In this
                  paper, we introduce PeakRanger, a peak caller
                  software package that works equally well on punctate
                  and broad sites, can resolve closely-spaced peaks,
                  has excellent performance, and is easily
                  customized. In addition, PeakRanger can be run in a
                  parallel cloud computing environment to obtain
                  extremely high performance on very large data
                  sets. We present a series of benchmarks to evaluate
                  PeakRanger against 10 other peak callers, and
                  demonstrate the performance of PeakRanger on both
                  real and synthetic data sets. We also present real
                  world usages of PeakRanger, including peak-calling
                  in the modENCODE project.CONCLUSIONS:Compared to
                  other peak callers tested, PeakRanger offers
                  improved resolution in distinguishing extremely
                  closely-spaced peaks. PeakRanger has above-average
                  spatial accuracy in terms of identifying the precise
                  location of binding events. PeakRanger also has
                  excellent sensitivity and specificity in all
                  benchmarks evaluated. In addition, PeakRanger offers
                  significant improvements in run time when running on
                  a single processor system, and very marked
                  improvements when allowed to take advantage of the
                  MapReduce parallel environment offered by a cloud

    abstract = {{The current understanding of the regulation of
                  transcription does not keep the pace with the
                  spectacular advances in the determination of genomic
                  sequences. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
                  massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) promises to
                  give better insight into transcription regulation by
                  locating sites of protein–DNA interactions. Such
                  loci of putative interactions can be inferred from
                  the genome-wide distributions of ChIP-seq data by
                  peak-calling software. The analysis of ChIP-seq data
                  critically depends on this step and a multitude of
                  these peak-callers have been deployed in the recent
                  years. A recent study reported severe variation
                  among peak-calling results. Yet, peak-calling still
                  lacks systematic quantitative benchmarking. Here, we
                  summarize benchmarking efforts and explain potential
                  drawbacks of each benchmarking method.}},

@article{Laajala_review,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
                  massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is
                  increasingly being applied to study transcriptional
                  regulation on a genome-wide scale. While numerous
                  algorithms have recently been proposed for analysing
                  the large ChIP-seq datasets, their relative merits
                  and potential limitations remain unclear in
                  practical applications.RESULTS:The present study
                  compares the state-of-the-art algorithms for
                  detecting transcription factor binding sites in four
                  diverse ChIP-seq datasets under a variety of
                  practical research settings. First, we demonstrate
                  how the biological conclusions may change
                  dramatically when the different algorithms are
                  applied. The reproducibility across biological
                  replicates is then investigated as an internal
                  validation of the detections. Finally, the predicted
                  binding sites with each method are compared to
                  high-scoring binding motifs as well as binding
                  regions confirmed in independent qPCR
                  experiments.CONCLUSIONS:In general, our results
                  indicate that the optimal choice of the
                  computational approach depends heavily on the
                  dataset under analysis. In addition to revealing
                  valuable information to the users of this technology
                  about the characteristics of the binding site
                  detection approaches, the systematic evaluation
                  framework provides also a useful reference to the
                  developers of improved algorithms for ChIP-seq
                  data.}},

                  and transcriptomes are increasingly done by deep DNA

                  comes at the cost of routinely handling tens to
                  hundreds of millions of reads. Whereas early

                  immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is revolutionizing
                  our ability to interrogate whole genome protein-DNA
                  interactions. Identification of protein binding
                  sites from ChIP-seq data has required novel
                  computational tools, distinct from those used for
                  the analysis of ChIP-Chip experiments. The growing
                  popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of
                  many different analytical programs (at last count,
                  we noted 31 open source methods), each with some
                  purported advantage. Given that the literature is
                  dense and empirical benchmarking challenging,
                  selecting an appropriate method for ChIP-seq
                  analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we
